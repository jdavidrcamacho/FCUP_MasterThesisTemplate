Template in latex of the Master's Thesis

To everyone that wants to use latex to write the thesis, FCUP only gives a powerpoint template to make the cover, as such I show you a trick  to put the cover in  latex.

Steps:

1)Use powerpoint to make the cover and save the result as pdf.

2)Import the pdf files to latex (check the .tex file for the code).

3)Covers are now made, you can now write the rest of the thesis.
