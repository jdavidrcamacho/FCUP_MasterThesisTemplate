### Template in latex of the Master's Thesis of FCUP ###

▒ If you are here it means you are now trying to write your first thesis, congrats!

At start FCUP only gives a powerpoint template to make the cover, as such I show you a trick to put the cover in latex. (No! I will not help you if you are using Word, grow up and use latex!) 

*1)* Use powerpoint to make the cover and save the result as pdf.

*2)* Import the pdf files to latex (check the .tex file for the code).

*3)* Covers are now made, you can now write the rest of the thesis.


▒ I also give you 2 versions of the thesis template that I believe it is explained by its titles. 

The *Color_template* gives you a pretty version the thesis where the bibliography, links, and other stuff are printed in colors, while in the *BlackWhite_template* only the picture you put in your thesis are shown in colors. 

▒ FAQ
